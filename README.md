# micrograd

Inspired by [Karpathy's micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), I wanted to build a tiny autograd engine from scratch as well. This repository was created for that purpose.  

It aims to provide a minimal yet functional implementation of automatic differentiation, helping to understand the core concepts behind backpropagation and deep learning frameworks.  

Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
